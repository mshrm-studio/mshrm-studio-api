# Mshrm.Studio 

> `The Mshrm.Studio Microservices project` is a our flagship application to showcase our work and explain what we can do, built with .Net Core and different software architecture and technologies like **Microservices Architecture**, **Domain Driven Design (DDD)**, **CQRS**, **Event Driven Architecture**. For communication between independent services, we use asynchronous messaging using Dapr [Dapr]([https://github.com/dapr](https://github.com/dapr)) on top of the rabbitmq library. For aggregator calls we use synchronous communication for real-time communications with using REST calls.

üí° This application mainly focuses on the technical. I have used a number of different technologies, software architecture designs, principles while creating this microservices app so this is a showcase of what we are offering. 

> **Warning**
> This project is in progress. I add new features over the time. You can check the [Release Notes (TBC.)](TBC.).

## Setup

### Dev Certificate (Windows)

This application uses `Https` so to run this locally, we have to trust the dev certs created by Visual Studio. If youre not using Visual Studio (creates a pfx for you), you can use below

```powershell
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https -ep ${HOME}/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx -p <CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER>
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Otherwise

```powershell
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

### Analyzers

Stylecop can be found in the `.editorconfig` file:

- [StyleCop/StyleCop](https://github.com/StyleCop/StyleCop)

## Application Architecture

The bellow architecture shows that there is 2 public APIs which are accessible for clients and are done via HTTP request/response. 

- The Aggregator API takes an HTTP request and aggregates data to/from to the corresponding microservice/s. The HTTP request is received by microservices that act as their own REST APIs. Each microservice is running within its own `Domain` and ONLY has direct access to its own databases, files, local transaction, etc. All these dependencies are only accessible for that microservice and not to the outside world. The microservices are decoupled from each other and are autonomous and therefore do not not rely on other parts in the system. This means they can run independently of other services.
- The Authorization API handles token generation and user management. The microservice is running within its own `Domain` and ONLY has direct access to its own databases, files, local transaction, etc. All these dependencies are only accessible for that microservice and not to the outside world.

Microservices are event based which means they can publish and/or subscribe to any events occurring in the setup using Dapr (exmaple below). By using this approach for communicating between services, each microservice does not need to know about the other services or handle errors occurred in other microservices. Dpar is used for this.

```csharp
await _daprClient.PublishEventAsync("pubsub", "send-email", new EmailDto() { EmailType = EmailType.PasswordReset, Link = "", ToEmailAddress = "test" }, cancellationToken);
```

The aggregator needs to know about all of the microservices it needs to communicate with. For this I have chosen to use NSwag which allows me to autogenerate clients with all the endpoints required for each microservice using the open API definition generated on msbuild. There is a Powersheel script included in the solution items of this project [here](https://github.com/mshrm-studio/mshrm-studio-api/blob/main/Mshrm.Studio/GenerateClients.ps1). Each microservice that requires a client to be generated must have an nswag.json file like can be found [here](https://github.com/mshrm-studio/mshrm-studio-api/blob/main/Mshrm.Studio/Mshrm.Studio.Domain.Api/nswag.json) in the domain microservice which are a list of the settings used. A breakdown of the script can be seen below.

```powershell
# Set any env vars required for application
$env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = 'Development';

# Get the solution folder (the parent directory of where this file lives)
$solutionFolder = (get-item $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path).Directory.FullName

# Get all projects to run EXCEPT the aggregator/shared library
$projectsToRun = Get-ChildItem $solutionFolder -Recurse -Filter '*.Api.csproj' | Where-Object {$_.Name -notmatch 'Mshrm.Studio.Api.csproj'} | Where-Object {$_.Name -notmatch 'Mshrm.Studio.Shared.csproj'}

# Build projects
$build = Invoke-MsBuild -Path (Get-ChildItem $solutionFolder -Recurse -Filter '*.sln')[0].FullName

# For each project, generate the clients
foreach ($project in $projectsToRun)
{
   Write-Host "Running: " + $($project)
   cd $project.Directory
   Invoke-Expression -Command "nswag run /runtime:Net80"
}
```

The clients are outputted to [here](https://github.com/mshrm-studio/mshrm-studio-api/tree/main/Mshrm.Studio/Mshrm.Studio.Api/Clients)

There are some Hangfire jobs that are run when the pricing application has started which can be found [here](https://github.com/mshrm-studio/mshrm-studio-api/blob/main/Mshrm.Studio/Mshrm.Studio.Pricing.Api/Extensions/JobConfigurationExtensions.cs). These import prices from all the providers configured for the currencies that exist in the database.

## Application Structure

</center>

Each micro service lives in its own folder and consists of 4 projects (following DDD)

### The presentation layer (Mshrm.Studio.X.Api - Web API)

This is the API in which our aggregator interacts with. It contains controllers and code to setup/support the running of the API

### The application layer (Mshrm.Studio.X.Application - Class library)

This contains the handlers/services and application related models (Dtos)

### The domain layer (Mshrm.Studio.X.Domain - Class library)

This contains the entities/aggregate roots as well as houses buisiness logic for the application

### The infrastructure layer (Mshrm.Studio.X.Infrastructure - Class library)

This is the persistance layer that allows communication with a database, houses migrations etc.

### Adding Migrations
add-migration <migration_name>

Flow:

- API endpoint (Controller)
- Request Input (Dto)
- Request Output (Dto)
- Some class to handle Request, For example Command and Command Handler or Query and Query Handler
- Data Model
